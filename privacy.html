                             </p>
                             <ul class="text-muted">

                             <h1 class="mt-5 mb-3">How Do We Use Your Email Address?</h1>
                             <p class="text-muted">By submitting your email address on this website, you agree to receive emails from us. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do. By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us. Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have provided the same email to us through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy. Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.</p>

                             <h1 class="mt-5 mb-3">How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h1>
                             <p class="text-muted">We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Cartsitu to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.</p>

                             <h1 class="mt-5 mb-3">How Do We Protect Your Information?</h1>
                             <p class="text-muted">We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to Cartsitu or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>

                             <h1 class="mt-5 mb-3">Your Consent</h1>
                             <p class="text-muted">By using our site, registering an account, or making a purchase, you consent to this Privacy Policy.</p>

                             <h1 class="mt-5 mb-3">Links to Other Websites</h1>
                             <p class="text-muted">This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by Cartsitu. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy or opinions expressed in such websites, and such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness by us. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Services to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our platform, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Such third parties may use their own cookies or other methods to collect information about you.</p>

                             <h1 class="mt-5 mb-3">Cookies</h1>
                             <p class="text-muted">Cartsitu uses "Cookies" to identify the areas of our website that you have visited. A Cookie is a small piece of data stored on your computer or mobile device by your web browser. We use Cookies to personalize the Content that you see on our website. Most web browsers can be set to disable the use of Cookies. However, if you disable Cookies, you may not be able to access functionality on our website correctly or at all. We never place Personally Identifiable Information in Cookies.</p>

                             <h1 class="mt-5 mb-3">Remarketing Services</h1>
                             <p class="text-muted">We use remarketing services. What Is Remarketing? In digital marketing, remarketing (or retargeting) is the practice of serving ads across the internet to people who have already visited your website. It allows your company to seem like they're “following” people around the internet by serving ads on the websites and platforms they use most.</p>

                             <h1 class="mt-5 mb-3">Payment Details</h1>
                             <p class="text-muted">In respect to any credit card or other payment processing details you have provided us, we commit that this confidential information will be stored in the most secure manner possible.</p>

                             <h1 class="mt-5 mb-3">Kids' Privacy</h1>
                             <p class="text-muted">We do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.</p>

                             <h1 class="mt-5 mb-3">Changes To Our Privacy Policy</h1>
                             <p class="text-muted">If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page, and/or update the Privacy Policy modification date below.</p>

                             <h1 class="mt-5 mb-3">Third-Party Services</h1>
                             <p class="text-muted">We may display, include or make available third-party content (including data, information, applications and other products services) or provide links to third-party websites or services ("Third- Party Services").</p>
                             <p class="text-muted">You acknowledge and agree that Cartsitu shall not be responsible for any Third-Party Services, including their accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect thereof.

                             <h1 class="mt-5 mb-3">What is personal data?</h1>
                             <p class="text-muted">Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.</p>
                             <p class="text-muted">The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>

                             <ul class="text-muted">
                                <li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li>
                                <li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li>
                                <li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
                                <li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li>
                             </ul>
                             <p class="text-muted">If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us.</p>
                             <p class="text-muted">We do not sell the Personal Information of our users.</p>
